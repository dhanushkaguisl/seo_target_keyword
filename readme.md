<h1>How to Optimize Web Pages for the Target Keyword </h1>


#### 1) Wrap Your Blog Post Title in an H1 Tag


#### 2) Wrap Subheadings in H2 Tags

<p>
Include your target keyword in at least one subheading. 
And wrap that subheading in an H2 tag.
</p>

#### 3) Keyword Frequency

<p>
Keyword Frequency is just like it sounds: It’s how many times your keyword appears in your content.
</p>

<p>
Try not to repeat the keyword phrase more than two times per page
</p>

#### 4) Use External (Outbound) Links

<p>External links are links on your site that point to other sites.</p>

<p>
A link (also known as a backlink) is a hyperlink that will direct a user from one page to another target page when clicked. 
Applied to a page by adding code like this:
</p>

```html

 <a href="http://www.domain.com/">target keyword</a>

```

<p>
An external link is any hyperlink or backlink, 
that points to a target page on another domain from the domain it’s published on. 
It’s external to the host domain.
</p>

#### 5) Add Internal Links

<ul>
   <li> 
   They help search engines understand your site’s structure and 
   how pages are related to each other
   </li>
  <li>
   They allow Google crawlers to discover and navigate to new pages
  </li>
  <li>
   They signal to Google that the linked-to page is valuable
  </li>
  <li>
   They help users navigate through your website (and keep them on your site longer)
  </li>
</ul>


#### 6) Front-load Your Title tag

<p> title tag is the most important on-page SEO factor</p>
<p>title tag gives search engines a high-level overview of what your page is all about</p>

#### 7) Use Unique, Keyword-Rich Meta Descriptions

<p>You want to give every image on your site a 
descriptive filename and alt text.</p>
